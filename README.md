# My Personal Site

Welcome! This is my personal website where I share notes, small experiments, and personal projects. It's a space for learning, exploration, and hopefully something others can benefit from too.

The site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), and styled with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).

You can visit it here: [elsandb.vercel.app](https://elsandb.vercel.app)

Feel free to explore the code, leave feedback, or fork it for your own use. Thanks for stopping by!
