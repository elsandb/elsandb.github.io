# My Personal Site

Welcome! This is my personal website where I plan to share notes and small experiments/personal projects.

The site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), and styled with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Visit here: [elsandb.vercel.app](https://elsandb.vercel.app)

Feel free to explore the code, leave feedback, or fork it for your own use.
